# RoboDSL Project Plan

## Project Overview
RoboDSL is a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) and compiler designed to simplify the development of GPU-accelerated robotics applications using ROS2 and CUDA. The goal is to abstract away the complexity of ROS2 and CUDA integration, allowing developers to focus on their application logic.

## Goals
1. **Simplify Development**: Provide a clean, declarative syntax for defining robotics applications
2. **Automate Boilerplate**: Generate ROS2 nodes, message definitions, and CUDA kernels
3. **Streamline Build Process**: Handle CMake configuration and build system generation
4. **Improve Performance**: Facilitate efficient GPU-CPU communication patterns
5. **Enhance Maintainability**: Support modern ROS2 features and best practices

## Current Status
- [x] Project setup and single-source CLI (Click)
- [x] Advanced DSL parser implementation with ROS2 features
- [x] ROS2 node generation with lifecycle support
- [x] CUDA kernel management with Thrust integration
- [x] Build system integration with CMake
- [x] Comprehensive documentation including:
  - DSL specification
  - Developer guide
  - Examples and tutorials
  - Troubleshooting and FAQ
- [x] ROS2 features implementation:
  - Lifecycle node support
  - QoS configuration
  - Namespace and remapping
  - Parameter handling
- [x] CUDA offloading support
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage (in progress)
- [ ] Performance benchmarking and optimization
